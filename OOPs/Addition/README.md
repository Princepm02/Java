## Introduction

This Java program showcases basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It defines a class named `num` to represent a container for two numbers and performs addition using objects of this class.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the Java program:

   ```bash
   javac Addition.java
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Addition
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will see the result of the addition operation printed to the console. The program adds two numbers, `a` and `b`, and displays the sum.

## Program Explanation

In this program:

- We define a class `num` inside the `Addition` class. This nested class represents a simple number container.
- The `num` class has two integer fields, `a` and `b`, with initial values of 5 and 10, respectively.
- In the `main` method, we create an instance of the `num` class named `obj`.
- We then add the values of `a` and `b` using `obj.a + obj.b` and print the result to the console.

This program serves as a basic example of encapsulating data within a class and demonstrates the concept of object-oriented programming.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this program to explore more OOP concepts in Java!
