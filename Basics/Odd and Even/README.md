## Odd and Even Number Generator

This Java program is designed to take an integer input 'num' and print the first 'num' even and odd numbers.

## Description

The program utilizes a simple loop-based approach to generate and display even and odd numbers based on the user's input 'num'.

### Input
- Enter an integer 'num,' which represents the number of even and odd numbers you want to generate.

### Output
- The program will then display the first 'num' even and odd numbers, separated by spaces.

Example:
```
Enter the number for N odd & N Even numbers:
5
5 Even Numbers:
0 2 4 6 8

5 Odd Numbers:
1 3 5 7 9
```

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing the `main` method in the `Odd_and_Even` class.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the desired value of 'num'.
3. The program will generate and display the specified number of even and odd numbers.

### Alternate Logic

The program includes an alternate logic using a while loop, which achieves the same result as the primary logic. To use the alternate logic, comment out the primary logic block and uncomment the alternate logic block, then recompile and run the program.
