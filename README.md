# Java

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs covering various fundamental concepts and use cases. These programs are designed for beginners who are learning Java programming and cover topics like arrays, OOP principles, and basic algorithms.

## Programs Included

1. **2D Array** - Demonstrates the creation, initialization, and manipulation of two-dimensional arrays in Java.
2. **ATM** - A simple ATM simulator that handles basic banking transactions like checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money.
3. **Basics** - Core Java basics, including variable declarations, data types, loops, and conditionals.
4. **EMI and Salary** - Calculates Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for loans and basic salary computation based on different factors.
5. **Matrix Arithmetic Operation** - Basic matrix operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.
6. **Methods** - Examples of defining and using methods (functions) in Java for modular programming.
7. **Number of Days** -  Calculates the day of the week that will occur after a specified number of days, given a starting day of the week
8. **OOPS** - Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
9. **Overloading and Overwriting** - Examples showing method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (subclass-specific method implementation).
10. **Pattern** - Prints various patterns (such as triangles, pyramids) using loops to help understand nested loops.
11. **Valid Date** - Validates date input based on day, month, and year constraints, checking for leap years as applicable.
