# Matrix Addition Program

This Java program allows users to input two matrices, perform addition of corresponding elements from the two matrices, and display the resulting matrix, which represents the sum of the input matrices. Before adding matrices, the program checks if their dimensions are the same and prompts the user to enter valid dimensions if they are not.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `Sum_2d_Array.java` file.

2. Compile the Java program using the following command:

   ```shell
   javac Sum_2d_Array.java
   ```

3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   java Sum_2d_Array
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the dimensions (rows and columns) and elements of the two matrices.

   - Enter the number of rows and columns for the first matrix.
   - Enter the number of rows and columns for the second matrix.

   The program will ensure that the dimensions of both matrices are the same.

5. Enter the values for the elements of both matrices as prompted.

6. The program will calculate the sum of corresponding elements from both matrices and display the resulting sum matrix.

7. To exit the program, simply close the terminal or console window.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```
Enter the no. of row First matrix:
2
Enter the no. of Column First matrix:
2
Enter the no. of row Second matrix:
2
Enter the no. of Column Second matrix:
2
Enter 4 values of First Matrix:
1 2
3 4
Enter 4 values of Second Matrix:
5 6
7 8
Addition of the arrays:
6 8
10 12
```

## Note

- The program will continuously prompt the user to enter matrix dimensions until they match for both matrices. If the dimensions are not the same, it will display an error message and request new dimensions.
- Make sure to enter the matrix elements separated by spaces and press Enter after each element.
- The resulting sum matrix will be displayed in the console.

Enjoy using the Matrix Addition Program!
