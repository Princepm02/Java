# Matrix Transpose Program

This is a simple Java program that allows you to create a matrix, input its values, and then print both the original matrix and its transpose. The transpose of a matrix involves swapping its rows and columns.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the program up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this Java program, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the program:

1. Clone the repository or download the Java source code file (`Transpose_Matrix.java`) to your local machine.

2. Compile the Java source code using the `javac` command:

   ```bash
   javac Transpose_Matrix.java
   ```

3. Run the compiled program using the `java` command:

   ```bash
   java Transpose_Matrix
   ```

3. The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix and then ask you to input the matrix values.

4. After entering the matrix values, the program will display the original matrix.

5. Finally, the program will calculate and display the transpose of the matrix.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```plaintext
Enter the no. of row matrix:
3
Enter the no. of Column matrix:
2
Enter 6 values of Matrix:
1 2
3 4
5 6
Given Matrix:
1 2
3 4
5 6
Transpose of Matrix:
1 3 5
2 4 6
```

In this example, we created a 3x2 matrix, input its values, and then printed both the original and transposed matrices.

Feel free to use and modify this Java program as needed for your matrix manipulation needs!
