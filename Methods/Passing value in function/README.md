# Demonstrating Value Passing in Functions

This Java program demonstrates the concept of passing values to a function by implementing a simple array sorting algorithm. The program allows users to input an array of integers, sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm, and then displays the sorted array.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `Passing_Value.java` file to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `Passing_Value.java` file is located.

3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac Passing_Value.java
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Passing_Value
   ```

## Program Overview

- The program starts by asking the user to input the number of elements in the array.

- It then prompts the user to enter the elements of the array.

- The `Sorting` function is called, which performs the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order.

- Finally, the sorted array is displayed to the user.

## Example Usage

1. Enter the number of elements in the array.

   ```bash
   Enter the no. of elements in array :
   5
   ```

2. Enter the elements of the array.

   ```bash
   Enter the 5 elements of the array :
   4
   2
   7
   1
   9
   ```

3. The program will then display the sorted array.

   ```bash
   Sorted array :
   1 2 4 7 9
   ```
