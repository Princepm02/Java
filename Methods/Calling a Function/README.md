# Sorting Program by Calling a Function

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the sorting of an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. The program takes user input to determine the number of elements in the array and then proceeds to input the elements. After sorting the array, it displays the sorted elements.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this program, make sure you have the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `Calling_Function.java` file.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `Calling_Function.java` file is located.

3. Compile the Java program by running the following command:

   ```bash
   javac Calling_Function.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled program with the following command:

   ```bash
   java Calling_Function
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the number of elements in the array and the elements themselves.

6. The program will sort the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm and display the sorted array.

## Program Explanation

- The `main` method is the entry point of the program, where it prints a message and then calls the `Sorting` method.

- The `Sorting` method initializes an array, takes user input for elements, sorts the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and finally prints the sorted array.
