# Sorting Array and Returning Sorted Array

This Java program demonstrates a function that sorts an array of integers and returns the sorted array. The program takes input from the user, sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm, and then prints the sorted array.

## Getting Started

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `Return_Value.java` file.

4. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac Return_Value.java
   ```

5. Run the program with:

   ```bash
   java Return_Value
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the number of elements and the elements of the array.

7. The program will then sort the array and display the sorted result.

## Program Explanation

- The `Sorting` function implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort the input array in ascending order.

- The `main` method of the program does the following:
  - Takes user input for the number of elements and the elements of the array.
  - Calls the `Sorting` function to sort the array.
  - Prints the sorted array.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program works:

```
Sorting of Array
Enter the no. of elements in the array : 
5
Enter the 5 elements of the array : 
4 1 5 2 3
Sorted array : 
1 2 3 4 5
```
